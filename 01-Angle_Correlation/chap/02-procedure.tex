The setup consists of two detectors, discussed in \autoref{sec:detectors}, centered around the $\gamma$-source, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:setup}.
As both detectors are located at a certain distance from the radiation source, the solid angle of detected radiation has to be accounted for in the analysis.
Unfortunately, these corrections are not the same for all measurement series, as the used construction's detector arms vary in distance.

\section{Measurement}

	\label{fig:e_spectrum}
\end{figure}
To make sure both detector channels have the same energy scale and to determine a threshold, the spectrum of the first measurement is examined.
\autoref{fig:e_spectrum} shows this energy spectrum.
An energy threshold is necessary to filter out any lower energy random coincidences caused by Compton scattering and the like.
This threshold is set at channel number 3700, which roughly equals 60\% of the center point's energy between the photopeaks.
Six measurement series for 3 angles, each with an acquisition time of $T=\SI{320}{\second}$ are conducted.
One measurement with no active isotope is carried out to account for background radiation.
During background analysis, the detectors confine an angle of \SI{90}{\degree} to correct for expected environment anisotropy.
