\chapter{Introduction}
Magnetic Resonance is used to find energies of possible quantum transitions in materials.
A sample in an oscillating field can absorb energy when the oscillating frequency coincides with the energy difference between two quantum states. %and some other rules are met (include?)
In both experiments, an external magnetic field is applied to lift the degeneracy of different magnetic states of particles that carry a magnetic dipole, creating the different energy states.
